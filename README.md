# Alleyway-invaders

An example 5-hour timed test to demonstrate JS OOP concepts. This was our first timed tech test. We were required to take an OOP approach, creating different types of ships and apply damage at random. Once a ship's HP reached 0 it should not be hit again, and the death of the mothership should cause all the ships to die. It was specified this challenge needed to be completed within a single HTML file in under 150 lines of code. Styling was unimportant for the brief, but has been added as an extension.
